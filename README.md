# SortingAlgorithm-Matlab
Recursive sort algorithm for Matlab

Sort vector 'vect' using a recursive sort algorithm consisting in a change of variable to distribute the values in different intervals until there are one or two values in each interval.

vect_sort is a vector consisting of the sorted values of 'vect' in ascended order.
link is a vector consisting of the initial positions of 'vect'

This algorithm supports a set of Real numbers with repeated numbers.
Takes O(n*log(n))time.
